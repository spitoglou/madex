## 1. Implementation

- [x] 1.1 Modify `generate_model_predictions()` to add random variance (±0-15 mg/dL) to predictions
- [x] 1.2 Ensure variance is applied symmetrically so both models maintain equal absolute errors (RMSE/MAE)
- [x] 1.3 Verify RMSE and MAE remain equal between Model A and Model B
- [x] 1.4 Modify `generate_timeseries_plot()` to show prediction markers only outside euglycemic range
- [x] 1.5 Run sandbox CLI to verify updated graphs
- [x] 1.6 Run tests to ensure no regressions
