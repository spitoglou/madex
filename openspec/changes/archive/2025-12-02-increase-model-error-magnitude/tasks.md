## 1. Implementation

- [x] 1.1 Increase error magnitude arrays for all 8 scenarios (A-H) by a factor that pushes predictions outside Zone A
- [x] 1.2 Verify boundary controls still clamp predictions to valid physiological ranges
- [x] 1.3 Regenerate model predictions with new error magnitudes
- [x] 1.4 Run CLI sandbox analysis to verify Zone A percentages are reduced
- [x] 1.5 Run tests to ensure no regressions
